# So... this probably needs an explanation
# Here I am parsing the WPN documents page. However, unlike the Rules page, this site doesn't have the common decency
# to render all the links directly in HTML. Instead, it's a Vue site that renders only a couple and requires a button
# click to load more of them. An automated Python scraper has a hard time clicking buttons, so I had to get the data
# from someplace else. The site uses Nuxt for state management, so all the data I need is actually included in a
# window.__NUXT__ property. Parsing that property proves to be a challenge though, because
# a) it's loaded as an IIFE, which means the result includes function parameters and whatnot,
# b) the return value isn't JSON, but a JS object literal, which doesn't have quoted keys (among other niceties)
# I could use selenium to render the page, but I really didn't feel like spinning up a webdriver instance just for this.
# Instead, I first use regex to get the return value of the function (luckily it's just a return instruction),
# then do some hacky pre-processing and throw it into a HJSON parser (which is a superset of JSON).
# This works, but is *very* brittle, so at even the slightest issue we just abort and send a notification
