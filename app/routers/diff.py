    Returns a diff of the CR between the two specified sets. Diffs only exist for neighboring CR releases. The path
    parameters are **not** case sensitive.

    The `changes` property is an ordered array of diff items, with each item consisting of the `old` and `new`
    versions of a rule. If a new rule is added, `old` is `null`. If an old rule is deleted, `new` is `null`.
    Otherwise, the differing parts of the `ruleText` string are wrapped between "<<<<" and ">>>>". Rules with
    identical text but changed rule number aren't part of this array, and neither are rules whose only change in text
    was a reference to a renumbered rule.

    `source_set` and `dest_set` contain full names of the sets being diffed, and the `nav` property stores set codes
    of diffs immediately preceding/following this one
